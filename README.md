### Title

Trivia-With-Friends

### Description

The user is given the options of deciding the number of questions, subject category, and a difficulty level. Once they have selected through the options they will start the game. A timer is set giving the user 15 seconds to answer a question. If the user takes too long or selects the wrong answer, it will be marked as wrong and deduct 10 seconds. When a wrong answer is selected a giphy of Darth Vader pops up and says "Don't fail me again". If the user selects the correct answer a giphy of Yoda pops up and says "The force will be with you, always". Once the user has cycled through the questions, "Game Over" will pop up on the screen. The score you get is the amount of time that is left in the game. The user will be prompted to input their initials. Once the user enters their initials they will be brought to the highscores page which lists the top 10 scores on the local device being used.
